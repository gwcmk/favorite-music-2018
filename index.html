            <h5>Earl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs</h5>
            <p class="quote">
              "If you ain’t got shit to say, niggas really are not gonna want to hear you on a loop. You can get away
              with it when the beat is changing and showing you when the emotion changes. But that loop, that’s just a
              background."<br>
            </p>
            <p>
              I was going through some dark times this year, and because of that I deliberately avoided listening to
              <em>Some Rap Songs</em>. Given that Earl went through his father's death earlier this year, I was
              hesitant
              to put
              myself in that headspace. I'm in a bit of a better place now, so I've spent the past week listening to
              it. The more I listen and unpack the stuff he's saying, I’m blown away by how affecting it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              What has always drawn me to Earl Sweatshirt’s music is that he raps with purpose. Even as a teenager, his
              verses were amazing displays of technical skill. As he’s matured into the artist that he is today, he has
              also developed a mastery of songwriting. Some of his raps from earlier years are the most realistic and
              chilling depictions of depression and anxiety that I've heard.
              <em>Doris</em> marked a shift in tone, and ever since, Earl’s music has been deeply personal. However,
              back then,
              it felt like he still had something to prove. As Vince Staples expressed on “Burgundy” even if it was in
              jest, many fans were enamored more with his rapping ability than what he had to say: “Don't nobody care
              about how you feel, we want raps, nigga." And the fans got what they wanted, with some incredibly dense
              and lyrical verses throughout.
              <em>Some Rap Songs</em> has none of that posturing and finds Earl taking the next step of introspection.
              It’s such
              a meticulously crafted project and undoubtedly the most unique and captivating listen of the year.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s obvious that none of these songs were intended to ever be played on the radio, let alone be dropped
              as a single. When “Nowhere2go” came out, he said himself that, “It’s also the first track getting
              released cause I’m not a single ass nigga. It’s the closest thing I got to a damn single.” What’s clear
              though is that this is the deepest dive we’ve gotten into Earl’s mind. The production is unrefined with
              wildly varying quality and polish, and Earl’s raps are not as razor sharp as before. Rather than
              appearing lazy though, there’s an intentionality to these creative choices that brings intimacy to these
              tracks, as if he’s recording his thoughts for himself instead of an audience.
            </p>

              From <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/interview-earl-sweatshirt.html" target="_blank">his great
                interview with Vulture</a>, Earl discussed the imperfections and subtleties of <em>Some Rap
                Songs</em>:<br>
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              "Yeah, it’s more human. ... I always just revert back to when I was younger because that’s when you
              haven’t learned so much, and all this bullshit hasn’t become, like, calloused on your brain. I go off
              what would make me soar in my room by myself as a child."
            </p>
            <p>
              It's often easy to be thinking too much when listening to rap. When I hear someone going off, rapping as
              fast as they can, I'm no longer interested in keeping up. There's a bit of authenticity lost there. If I
              need to read genius annotations just to understand what the fuck you’re saying, how can you really be
              aiming to evoke any sort of genuine reaction? No one thinks like that. What's much more interesting is
              what Earl is doing here—getting to something real.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that's what cut through everything for me. The raw feelings as well as the
              crushing weight of
              depression were so vivid. I felt the lows of hopelessness, the fleeting but empty
              reprieve of unhealthy coping, the longing for happiness. As the album closes, the penultimate track
              "Peanut" is possibly the most emotionally arresting song I've ever heard.

            </p>
            <p>
              I haven't experienced anything as traumatic as his father's death, but I couldn't help but be pulled back
              into it, feeling like you're spiraling with no end in sight and wanting nothing more than to escape. It's
              overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              As it segues into "Riot!", the instrumental final track, the guitars and horns of the Hugh Masekela
              sample give way to acceptance. The sounds wobble and fade out, and it's unclear what's next. In place of
              an absence of hope is uncertainty. Beyond that though, I can’t help but feel a sense of
              resolve. In the face of darkness, the best we can do is move forward. It seems so simple, but coming from
              your lowest point and actually grasping that ideal can be such a painful journey.

            <p>This album felt nostalgic to me. <em>Championships</em> is like the pre-Soundcloud big budget
              blockbuster albums that we used to get from rappers at the top of the game. Pretty much every big name in
              rap shows up on a
              feature or production credit. What
              makes it great though is Meek Mill's raps, back with the same intensity that he's always brought to
              his albums.
              Every time you heard him on a track, his verses demanded your attention, and newly reborn with a purpose
              of criminal justice reform, we now have a really good reason to listen.</p>
