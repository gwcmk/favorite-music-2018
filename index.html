            <h5>Earl Sweatshirt - Some Rap Songs</h5>
            <p>
              I was going through some dark times this year, and because of that I deliberately avoided carefully
              listening to this album. I consider Earl to be one of the greatest rappers alive today due of his
              technical ability. But what puts him in the conversation of one of the all time greats is his songwriting
              ability. Some of his raps from earlier years are the most disturbingly lucid depictions of
              depression and anxiety that I've heard. Given that he went through his father's death earlier this year,
              I was hesitant to put myself in that headspace.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm in a bit of a better place now, so I've spent the past week really listening to this album. The more
              I listen to it and unpack the stuff he's saying...I don't think I've ever heard anything this heavy.
            </p>
            <p>
              From <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/11/interview-earl-sweatshirt.html" target="_blank">his great
                interview with Vulture</a>, Earl discussed the imperfections and subtleties of <em>Some Rap
                Songs</em>:<br>
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              "Yeah, it’s more human. ... I always just revert back to when I was younger because that’s when you
              haven’t learned so much, and all this bullshit hasn’t become, like, calloused on your brain. I go off
              what would make me soar in my room by myself as a child."
            </p>
            <p>
              It's often easy to be thinking too much when
              listening to music, especially if that's what is expected by the artist. When I hear someone going off,
              rapping as
              fast as they can, I'm no longer interested in keeping up. There's a bit of authenticity lost there. How
              can you really be aiming to evoke any kind of genuine response? No one thinks like that. What's much
              more interesting is actually expressing yourself and getting to something real, like Earl said.
            </p>
            <p>
              And that's what cut through everything for me. The raw feelings as well as the
              crushing weight of
              depression were so vivid. I felt the lows of hopelessness, the fleeting but empty
              reprieve of unhealthy coping, the longing for happiness. As the album closes, the penultimate track
              "Peanut" is possibly the most emotionally arresting song I've ever heard.
            </p>

              </em>
            </p>
            <p>
              I haven't experienced anything as traumatic as his father's death, but I couldn't help but be pulled back
              into it, feeling like you're spiraling with no end in sight and wanting nothing more than to escape. It's
              overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
              As it segues into the last track, the instrumental "Riot!", the guitars and horns of the Hugh Masekela
              sample finally
              give way to a reprieve. The sounds wobble and fade out, and it's unclear what's next.
              In place of the absence of hope is
              a sense of uncertainty but possibly also resolve. In the face of darkness, the best we can do is move
              forward. I think we
              all know that, but coming from your lowest point and actually grasping that ideal can be such a painful
              journey.

            <h5>Meek Mill - Championships</h5>
            <p>This album felt nostalgic to me. <em>Championships</em> is like the pre-Soundcloud big budget
              blockbuster albums that we used to get from rappers at the top of the game. Pretty much every big name in
              rap shows up on a
              feature or production credit. What
              makes it great though is Meek Mill, back with the same intensity that he's always brought to his albums.
              Every time you heard him on a track, his verses demanded your attention, and newly reborn with a purpose
              of criminal justice reform, we now have a really good reason to listen.</p>

            <p>after I heard this song, I spent a few hours listening to country music because I realized that I might
              be missing a lot of good music...everything else was kinda trash. still love this song tho</p>

            <p>Sad that we never got to see the rest of "surgical summer" but glad that someone took Drake down a few
